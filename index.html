        <h1>About The film</h1>
        <p>
            <span>LIVE RICH SPREAD WEALTH</span> is a documentary that takes us on the journey to defining and refining the true meaning of being rich told through the life of self-made millionaire, best-selling author, and founder of the Live Rich Spread Wealth Movement Melissa Hughes. 

            Live Rich Spread Wealth tells the story of how the vision and passion of one soul can shape the lives of many, and the necessity of fighting to sustain what you believe in - no matter what happens. It is a story for people of all ages, one that will inspire, educate, and provoke a spirit of possibility. 
            
            Melissa, born to Jamaican parents who came to America to provide a better life for their family, seemingly has it all - the family the business, and the respect of her peers, but the pathway to what she calls "living rich" has not been an easy one. In fact, it was her upward climb from Corporate America to becoming a millionaire by the age of 31, conquering a failed business, filing bankruptcy, divorce, racism, and disruption that allowed her to ultimately redefine what truly being "rich" is.
            
            Through her determination and grit, she set out to create a community of giants around the world where being bold and brilliant was the norm. She now is poised to create thousands of 6 and 7 figure businesses.
            
            Live Rich Spread Wealth provides a touching view of how to gain the mindset and courage to become who you were called to be in this world. It's an inspiring story of how to make it - how to be wildly successful without compromising who you are and what you believe. 
            
            It's a story of legacy, and building generational wealth to leave your imprint on the world, and it's a story of resilience and finding the ability to bounce back from any obstacle you are faced with.
            
            Starring in Live Rich Spread Wealth are some of the nations top entrepreneurs, consultants, and business icons who detail their impact of discovering what Live Rich Spread Wealth really means and the impact Melissa has had on their business and life.
            
            Woven through this inspirational all access pass is the thread of the life and legacy of Melissa's family, particularly her Jamaican Grandmother and Grandfather which laid the entrepreneurial and spiritual foundation for her massive success. 
            
            The documentary film is directed by filmmaker and four-time author Brandi Mitchell who has researched and studied Melissa for more than a decade and has passionately captured the essence of the Live Rich Spread Wealth movement.
